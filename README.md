# #include
## A diversity group for C++ developers.

This started as a play on words, but it seems to have caught on with a few members of the community. Diversity has concerned me for a while now, and I originally considered under-representation of women and ethnic minorities in the development industry. A slack group was created and I realised that there is more to it than that: who we think our clients are is also an issue, and is how we categorise our unconscious biases.

I'm a software developer, not a politician, nor a diversity specialist or academic, so I need some help here. If such a group that concerns itself with these matters is going to exist, it needs to have a charter: a purpose, expectations and so on. Here are some items to start with. I'm open for pull requests: bear in mind that, as I said, I'm a working developer, so don't expect speedy turnaround.
1. Software development is a problem-solving discipline, the pursuit of which is not suited towards any particular categorisation of people, demanding only intellectual acuity, rigour and stamina.
2. Lack of diversity diminishes the discipline by reducing the pool of talent available to solve pressing software development problems.
3. Lack of awareness of diversity diminishes the discipline by considering only a small portion of potential users in the solution domain.
4. The appeal of software development, and the horizons of existing developers, must be broadened, such that ALL may be included in the talent pool and ALL may be included in the user domain.

As you can see, it's a work in progress. All help welcomed by me and, ultimately, the rest of the discipline.

## Useful resources

* [Managing unconscious bias -- Facebook](https://managingbias.fb.com/)
 * A series of videos on recognising unconscious biases which you have and suggestions on how to counter them.
 * Split into multiple sections:
  * Series introduction
  * First impressions -- if you aren't sure about watching the series, watch this one; it will get you thinking about your own biases which you may not have thought about before.
  * Stereotypes and performance bias
  * Performance attribution bias
  * Competence/Likeability tradeoff bias
  * Maternal bias
  * Business case for diversity and inclusion
 * The content is very well presented and the videos can be watched independently of one another.
* [eLesson: Unconscious Bias -- Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/training/default.aspx)
 * More of a corporate approach, which may be boring for some engineers, but there's some good content.
 * This is mostly focused on meetings rather than the many other forms of collaboration which we use.
 * If you are a manager then this is probably a better option than the Facebook one.
* [Implicit social attitude tests -- Harvard](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/)
 * A collection of tests which can help you identify unconsious biases.
 * Doing even one of these is very valuable, and the results can be surprising.
